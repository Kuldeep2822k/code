## 2024-05-22 - Content Security Policy Constraints
**Vulnerability:** Extensive use of `innerHTML` and inline event handlers in `script.js` and HTML files.
**Learning:** This architecture necessitates `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` and `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` in CSP, significantly reducing the policy's effectiveness against XSS.
**Prevention:** In future refactors, move event handlers to JavaScript files using `addEventListener` and avoid `innerHTML` for user-controlled data to allow a stricter CSP.

## 2025-05-23 - DOM Event Handler Security
**Vulnerability:** The use of `onclick` attributes in `innerHTML` strings (e.g., `onclick="mealCalculator.removeItem('${item.id}')"`) creates an XSS vulnerability if the interpolated variables are controlled by an attacker.
**Learning:** Even with escaping, inline event handlers are risky and violate CSP best practices.
**Prevention:** Always attach event listeners programmatically using `addEventListener` after creating elements, which also keeps the data in the closure scope rather than exposing it in the HTML.

## 2025-05-24 - Dead Code Concealment
**Vulnerability:** Duplicate modal definitions in HTML and JS (e.g., `#recipe-modal`) where the HTML version relied on inline handlers (`onclick`, `onsubmit`) while the JS version (the one actually active) used a different structure.
**Learning:** Inline handlers can create an illusion of functionality in dead code. Removing them forces a cleanup of unused HTML and reveals the true application logic flow.
**Prevention:** Avoid duplicating UI components in HTML if they are dynamically generated by JS. Use `addEventListener` to bind logic to the *active* DOM elements.
