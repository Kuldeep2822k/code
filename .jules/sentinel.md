## 2024-05-22 - Content Security Policy Constraints
**Vulnerability:** Extensive use of `innerHTML` and inline event handlers in `script.js` and HTML files.
**Learning:** This architecture necessitates `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` and `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` in CSP, significantly reducing the policy's effectiveness against XSS.
**Prevention:** In future refactors, move event handlers to JavaScript files using `addEventListener` and avoid `innerHTML` for user-controlled data to allow a stricter CSP.

## 2025-05-23 - DOM Event Handler Security
**Vulnerability:** The use of `onclick` attributes in `innerHTML` strings (e.g., `onclick="mealCalculator.removeItem('${item.id}')"`) creates an XSS vulnerability if the interpolated variables are controlled by an attacker.
**Learning:** Even with escaping, inline event handlers are risky and violate CSP best practices.
**Prevention:** Always attach event listeners programmatically using `addEventListener` after creating elements, which also keeps the data in the closure scope rather than exposing it in the HTML.

## 2025-05-24 - Trust Boundaries in Storage
**Vulnerability:** `script.js` assumed data loaded from `localStorage` (like calories and portions) was safe and numeric, rendering it directly into `innerHTML` without escaping.
**Learning:** Data from `localStorage` must be treated as untrusted input, identical to user input or URL parameters, as it can be compromised.
**Prevention:** Always escape ALL interpolated variables in HTML templates, even those expected to be numbers, using `escapeHtml()`.
